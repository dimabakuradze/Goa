        <b style="text-align: center;">Byung-chul established a trucking business in Busan on 1 March 1938, which he named Samsung Trading Co, the forerunner to Samsung.[6] Samsung means "Three Stars" which explains the initial corporate logos.

            By 1945 Samsung was transporting goods throughout Korea and to other countries. The company was based in Seoul by 1947.[7] It was one of the ten largest "trading companies" when the Korean War started in 1950.[8] With the conquest of Seoul by the North Korean army, Lee was forced to relocate his business to Busan. The massive influx of U.S. troops and equipment into Busan over the next year and a half of the war proved to be highly beneficial to Lee's trading company.[8</b>
